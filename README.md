- 👋 Hi, I’m Aleksandra! I worked as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, AI Architect and led ML Engineering projects
- 💻 I code in Python (with expertise in GenAI, LLMs, AI Agents, RAG-based systems, and traditional Machine Learning techniques).
- 📌 Currently working on AI Agents [Soul Agents](https://www.x.com/soul_agents/) (backed by mystri.eth) - building autonomous AI agents for Web3 and building Automated AI pipelines for content and knowledge extraction for WallStreet Fintech Kinetix Trading [https://www.kinetixtt.com/](https://www.kinetixtt.com/).
- 🏆 Fun fact: I did AI before the hype, in 2019 I contributed to the non-profit organization teaching AI & Machine Learning - TechLabs (2018 Google Impact Challenge Winner), which initiated my great passion for making AI concepts accessible to a wide audience. Since 2018 I have done vast scientific research on transformers and naural networks.
